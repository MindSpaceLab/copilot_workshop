# copilot_workshop


If you want to follow along and experiment using your own device, you will need to do the following. I recommend doing so at least a week before the workshop in the event of any authorization issues.

1) Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2) Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/). These may also be already available via the Bond software page.
3) Signup for [github](https://github.com/signup)
4) Link and authorize your staff or student account for [Education Plan access](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application)
5) Get some of your own data to use for the exercises (optional)

We'll go through the process of activating the extension in VS Code, and how to use it for Python or R on the day.

Visual Studio Code, or VS Code, is an integrated development environment (IDE). It allows you to write and run code from a range of differnet programming languages (e.g., C, Java), and also has a range of useful plugins and extensions. It's particuarlly good for Python and R code.

2) What is Anaconda?

Anaconda is a Python distribution. It's a slightly easier way of installing Pythong, along with a range of helpful tools.

No, but Copilot usually costs ~$20USD per month.
